A Horse With No Name is a simple yet challenging game, taken from the popular QWOP-style of controls with the grace and power of a horse.

It is a 2d game that will be developed using the Unity Engine. It will be available for MacOS and Windows PC. This is a 2-player game wherein the players will have to work together in order to make the horse run as far as they possibly can. The game ends only if the horse tumbles down and its head hits the ground.
